# Kernel Method Data Challenge 2024-2025 - Team Name: Bonsoir

## Introduction
This repository contains my work for the Kernel Methods Data Challenge as part of the MVA Master program. I achieved a final rank of 1/37 on both the public and private leaderboards. The challenge details can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-challenge-kernel-methods-2024-2025/leaderboard).

## Pre-computed Kernels
Due to their size (over 100 MB), the relevant pre-computed kernels are not included in the repository. They can be downloaded from the following [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bTJ4cJlorGnMaLRvCAFtVb1L8MBRXWT-?usp=sharing).

## Installation
Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Although scikit-learn is listed in the requirements, it is only used to enable kernel methods to inherit the clone method.
