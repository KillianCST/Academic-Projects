This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of **Cloud Transformers**, based on the paper:

📄 [Cloud Transformers: A Universal Approach to Point Cloud Processing Tasks (ICCV 2021)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Mazur_Cloud_Transformers_A_Universal_Approach_to_Point_Cloud_Processing_Tasks_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)

> Authors: Kirill Mazur, Victor Lempitsky  
> Conference: ICCV 2021

Cloud Transformers offer a unified and powerful architecture for handling various 3D point cloud tasks such as:

- Semantic segmentation  
- Classification  
- Inpainting / Completion  
- Image-to-point cloud generation
